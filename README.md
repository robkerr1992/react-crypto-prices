To run this project locally you will need to do a few things:

1. Get a cryptocompare API key from https://www.cryptocompare.com/ (they're free)
2. Make you sure you have the latest version of node and npm installed
3. Clone the repo
4. Create a file called .config.js and place it in the src/ directory
5. Add this code to that file:

```
const config = {
    apkiKey: 'your api key goes here (don't forget the quotes!)',
};
```

6. run 'npm install' inside the project directory
7. run 'npm start'
8. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Have fun!
